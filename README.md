<!-- How you created my interactive gallery and my reasoning for my design choice.  -->

First of all, before using JAVASCRIPT, I inserted all my images on HTML and I styled in terms of layout (CSS GRID) on CSS to have a better view of what I was expecting. 
On the other hand, I recently watched a famous movie called "ET" ,and at that moment all the things related to the "universe"  or " gallaxy" used to inspire me, that is the reason why I wanted to take a trip to that world via realizing my interactive gallery project. 
Also, I wanted to make the viewer travel to that large infinite universe, to make the viewer travel to the stars when he/she would see a picture of my gallery and he/she would like to click on.
I did on purpose that the color of my background radial-gradient matches with my pictures.



<!-- Your reflection should include what challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes. -->

    For this assignment, i struggled in several parts, I struggled in :

<!-- In the arrays part in javascript; -->
    I thought that I could list my images normally like this:
const pictures = [
  'pic1',
  'pic2',
  'pic3',
  'pic4'
];
However, I quickly figured it out that to identify each image better including a "file" and an "alt text" would be better.


<!-- For the popup image: -->
    This part was the most "intense" one because I was COMPLETELY lost, I didn't know which part to declare as "const", and which part was a "for loop", what variable to put in the function event, what keyword to use? "toggle", "target"? 
To do this, I watched some videos on Youtube regarding "interactive gallery". It helped to get some points, however to be honest I don't really master it. Additionnally, if my code works today it's thanks to the PA and Professor Natalia.



<!-- In inserting text  On an image: -->

    In fact, I'm affraid of javascript because when I figured it out my arrays and my popup images, I didnt want to touch anything on that file. Therefore,I was looking for other ways in Html and CSS and try to restyle it on CSS for hours and hours. However, someone highly recommended me to add an "h3" on the images.push part on javascript. And then I figured it out that I could put the ON the image by using "translateY" tag on CSS.



<!-- Finding the "perfect" breakpoint, and adapt all the images sizes through it: -->

    On the previous assignments, we use to have 3 breakpoints, therefore I decided to keep it like that. Later, I realized that I needed a 4th breakpoint because I couldn't figure it out the sizes of my images as well in the "interactive presententation part" as the popup part. 



<!-- Explanation what I learned by creating my interactive gallery. -->

To be honest, I realized that the more assignments I do, the best I master CSS by knowing which to target ( the parent or the child element) HTML as well.  
However, I still have difficulties in javascript, in terms of vizualization, structure and punctuation. 

But, I understand now the purpose of a "for loop", an "addEventListener" etc. I can get the theory quickly but I still need more pratice.

Hopefully, I will master it as soon as possible. I'll do my best to have a better understanding next time by doing exercices on codeacademy, and REDOING the in-class exercices on Codepen.
